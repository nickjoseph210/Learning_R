# Learning_R

This repo is my introduction to the programming language R, which is a very powerful statistical and data analysis tool despite - let's face it - having an insanely boring name.  'Python' evokes a bit of fear (even though it's named after one of my favorite English comedy troupes), and 'Java' sounds like something you'd write in a coffeeshop while eavesdropping on conversations at a nearby table.  'R' doesn't seem evoke that much respect, but after reading several Data Science articles and seeing its visualization and statistical powers, there's no reason that should be.  It seems like a wonderful tool, and I'll only be better at Data Science for learning it.

### Prepping System for R

Like most programming languages, 'R' requires downloading and system checking from its [website](https://www.r-project.org/).  

Much like Python, R has an interpreter that pops up onto your screen after it's downloaded.
